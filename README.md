# FoodVision

FoodVision builds upon the groundwork laid by the [FoodVisionMini](https://github.com/mrkrisgee/FoodVisionMini) experiment, which delved into the intricacies of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. With a foundation established, this project ventures further by training a model on the *[Food101 Image Data Set](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/)*. Deriven from insights gained in FoodVisionMini, the architecture employed here not only trains on the Food101 dataset but also extends its capabilities to make predictions on its own data and custom images sourced from the web.

## Dataset Description

The Food101 dataset consists of 101,000 images of food divided into 101 categories, with 1,000 images per category.
